        <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
          Angular is a full-fledged framework, while React is a library.
          React.js uses virtual DOM and one-way data binding while Angular
          operates on real DOM & two-way data binding. There’s also a difference
          in bundle size (React’s smaller) and speed (React works a bit faster).

        <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
          They're both great for front-end development. I prefer React over
          Angular because of isolated debugging, which helps us achieve better
          app's stability. Plus, React is a library, and we can integrate it
          into any project (even if it is made with Angular).

          React beats Angular in terms of performance, full backward
          compatibility, and smaller bundle size. The component-driven
          architecture of React lets devs re-use components, saving development
          time, and cost.

          React.js apps use virtual DOM that allows developers to virtually
          update changes without rewriting the entire HTML doc. It renders
          updates faster and ensures faster performance.

        <h2>Popularity</h2>
        <p>
          Stack Overflow names React.js the most loved and most wanted web
          framework by developers (74.5%). Angular has a lower rate – 57.6% of
          developers are interested in working with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          NPM counts 53,647 packages depending on React. The number of 8,140,830
          weekly downloads looks impressive too. That was trending React.
          Angular 2? Well, not that good: 1,609,139 weekly downloads and 10,128
          dependents.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the Stack Overflow survey I’ve just mentioned, more
          developers said they choose React over Angular: 31.3% of React.js vs.
          30.7% Angular.

        <h2>Bundle size</h2>
        <p>
          Why does size matter? The smaller is the file, the faster it loads.
          The faster it loads, the higher is the ranking – and, ultimately, the
          conversion rate (and margin).
        </p>
        <p>
          ReactJS uses webpack (splits your code into smaller parts), tree
          shaking, and dynamic imports that reduce the bundle size.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tree shaking (or dead-code elimination) means that unused modules
          won't be included in the bundle during the build process. With dynamic
          imports, the app loads the code needed initially--and load the rest on
          demand.

        <h2>Performence</h2>
        <p>
          React.js uses virtual DOM (Document Object Model – allows accessing
          and changing document contents, layout, and even structure). While
          Angular 2 operates on real DOM.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine you want to update user profile details, let’s say, their last
          name. Real DOM, instead of changing just that bit of info, updates the
          entire tree structure of HTML tables until it reaches the needed data.
          In our case, it's the last name.
        </p>
        <p>
          While virtual DOM allows us to update the changes without rewriting
          the entire HTML doc virtually. This renders updates much faster and
          ensures fast performance – no matter of the apps' size.
